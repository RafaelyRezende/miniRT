## Foudational Ray Tracer Engine

The goal of the project is to generate a scene by modeling light transport with the ray tracing technique. This technique is an improvement over rasterization image fidelity quality at the cost of system resources.

> "This technique was first deployed in applications where taking relatively long time to render could be tolerated" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))

As hardware became more and more powerful and efficient with the creation of specialized hardware for the fundamental operations of linear algebra, ray tracing became a standard of high quality and realistic scenes in computer graphics. Most of the triple A games in the industry utilize this technique to render digital objects.
